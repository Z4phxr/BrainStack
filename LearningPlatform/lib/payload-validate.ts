/**
 * Cross-schema document validation utilities.
 *
 * Problem: PostgreSQL cannot enforce foreign keys across schemas managed by
 * different owners (public → Prisma, payload → Payload CMS).  References such
 * as LessonProgress.lessonId and TaskProgress.taskId are plain Text columns
 * with no DB-level constraint.
 *
 * Solution: any code path that creates a Prisma progress record that references
 * a Payload CMS document MUST call requirePayloadDocument() first.  If the
 * document does not exist (or is unpublished for non-admin callers), this
 * function throws before the insert, preventing orphaned rows.
 *
 * These helpers are also used by lesson-progress.ts and submit-task.ts.
 * Adding them here makes the validation contract explicit, reusable, and easy
 * to audit in code review.
