 * The initial schema created a `question jsonb NOT NULL` column on `payload.tasks`.

 * column and copied the data across, but never dropped `question`.
 *
 * Every new insert from Payload writes `prompt` but omits `question`, which violates
 * the NOT NULL constraint and causes:
 *   "null value in column "question" of relation "tasks" violates not-null constraint"
 *
 * This migration removes the stale legacy column.
